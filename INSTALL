		Wordtip installation

To build Wordtip, you need the following libraries (and the
corresponding development packages probably as well):

boost, boost-test, glibmm, dbus-c++, gnome-common

Use "./configure", "make" and "make install" as usual.

If you want to build tests, pass "--enable-autotests" to configure.

If you're building source code from the git repository,
run "./autogen.sh" first.

Optionally you may want to pass "--prefix=/usr"
to either configure or autogen.sh.
