Wordtip is a text classification service for desktop and mobile
applications. It uses D-Bus as a messaging system to communicate
with clients.

Currently alpha and with just a simple implementation of
a Bayesian classifier, but it's working, and here's how you can
test it with Python:

----
import dbus

bus = dbus.SessionBus()
proxy = bus.get_object('org.freedesktop.Wordtip','/org/freedesktop/Wordtip')
wt = dbus.Interface(proxy, 'org.freedesktop.Wordtip')

# It first needs to be trained with a couple of examples:
wt.Train("the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", "happy")
wt.Train("the birds are singing and the sun is bright", "happy")
wt.Train("When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.", "license")
wt.Train("without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force", "license")

print wt.Classify("a quick sun came with me singing next to the fox")
print wt.Classify("terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions")
----
